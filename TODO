NOTE:
	The items are not in any order just in the order I cam up with them ;)

env/*:

	* Create a unified build system for tinyTimber and it's examples.

	* Figure out why the MSP430 environment breaks when taking overflow
	  into account in the timer_get() function, until then we will take
	  the long way around and just generate those extra interrupts.

	* Draw out guidelines for pre-emptive interrupts. This will allow the
	  kernel to leave protected mode while doing some things, such as
	  setting up variables and copying memory.

env/msp430:

	-

env/posix:

	* Make the ticks "dynamic", this is the right way to do it... Also
	  make the "interrupt" policy sane or at least get a policy. More
	  extensive use of inline functions for the timers and a general
	  rewrite of the timer code.

env/avr:

	* Need to look into how we should deal with the interrupts, we need to
	  save the state of a thread so we know if we should return from an
	  interrupt or regular user space.

env/arm7:

	* Figure out how to do this sligthly more portable? Or should we just live
	  with separate runtimes for the different models... Proabably the only
	  "sane" solution :/

	* Fix the AIC code so that nested interrupts are supported...
