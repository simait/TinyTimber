NOTE:
	The items are not in any order just in the order I cam up with them ;)

env/*:

	* Figure out why the MSP430 environment breaks when taking overflow
	  into account in the timer_get() function, until then we will take
	  the long way around and just generate those extra interrupts.

	* Draw out guidelines for pre-emptive interrupts. This will allow the
	  kernel to leave protected mode while doing some things, such as
	  setting up variables and copying memory.

env/arm7:

	* Figure out how to do this sligthly more portable? Or should we just live
	  with separate runtimes for the different models... Proabably the only
	  "sane" solution :/

	* Fix the AIC code so that nested interrupts are supported...
